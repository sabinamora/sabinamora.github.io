My interest is in providing professional services targeted to high performing organizations that need extra capacity to meet special deadlines or take-on challenging projects. 

My goal is to strengthen your organizational capacity through data driven approaches and authentic stakeholder engagement. I will identify and execute short-term, achievable steps within your long-term strategy. 

My focus has been on equitable and inclusive neighborhood economic development as well as downtown revitalization as a strategy to promote city-wide economic development (see about).
