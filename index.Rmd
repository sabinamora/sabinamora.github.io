My interest is in providing professional services targeted to high performing organizations that need additional capacity to meet special deadlines and take-on challenging projects. 

My goal is to strengthen organizational capacity through data driven approaches and authentic stakeholder engagement. I will identify and execute short-term, achievable steps within your long-term strategy. 

My focus is on neighborhood economic development and downtown revitalization strategies, small business assistance and incentives, and increasing the capacity and transparency of economic development organizations.
