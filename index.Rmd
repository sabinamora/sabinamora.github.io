My interest is in providing professional services to high performing organizations that need additional capacity to meet special deadlines and take-on challenging projects. 

My approach is to strengthen organizational capacity by providing technical assistance and authentic stakeholder engagement. I will identify and execute short-term, achievable steps that align with your organization's long-term goals.  

My focus is on neighborhood economic development and downtown revitalization, small business assistance and incentives, and increasing the capacity and transparency of economic development organizations and the work they do.
