I provide professional services to organizations that need additional capacity to meet special deadlines or take on challenging projects.

I work with you to strengthen organizational capacity by providing expert technical assistance and authentic stakeholder engagement in six focus areas:

| - Downtown and neighborhood economic development

| - Small business assistance and incentives
| - Business recruitment and expansion programs
| - Improving the transparency and performance of economic development organizations
