I have spent the last 11 years working for local government and economic development agencies at the state, regional, and municipal levels in communities across New York, Texas and California. My areas of focus  have been local economic development, small business assistance programs, business expansion and attraction programs, downtown and neighborhood development strategies, and economic development planning. I am bilingual in English & Spanish and can work effectively in both languages. 

I graduated from the University of Texas with a MS in community and regional planning and from the LBJ School of Public Affairs with a Master of Public Affairs in 2010. I’m an active member of the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) and on track to obtain my Certified Economic Developer (CEcD) certification in March 2021.

Most recently I joined the economic development team at the City of Mountain View, California where my focus has been on small business assistance as well as supporting the city’s visual arts and downtown initiatives. 
My full resume is available here.
